# Ensembles
Ensemble is a combimation of basic estimators that make predictions. 

Random Forest is a combination of Decision Trees. Each DT can see only subset of data and a fraction of features (Bagging + RSM).

Boosting consists of several estimators. Each next estimators predicts the error of previous estimator.
