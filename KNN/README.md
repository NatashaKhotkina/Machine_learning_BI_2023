K-nearest neighbour is an algorithm of classic Machine learning. 

Here you can find: 

- implementation of **KNN classifier**, metric scores for classification such as **precision, recall, f1, accuracy**; 

- usage example of **KNN regressor** from sklearn, implementation of metric scores for regression such as **R squared score, MSE, MAE**.
